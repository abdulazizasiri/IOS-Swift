 Closures can be one of these forms
 
 
 1- Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values.

 2- Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.

 
 3- Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.

 Closure expression
 
 Closure expressions are a way to write inline closures in a brief, focused syntax. Closure expressions provide several syntax optimizations for writing closures in a shortened form without loss of clarity or intent. The closure expression examples below illustrate these optimizations by refining a single example of the sorted(by:) method over several iterations, each of which expresses the same functionality in a more succinct way.

 
 // Synatc optimization: Shorter code.

// Using sorted(by: ). Using a function implmentation.

// 2- Inferring Type From Context:



// This is inferring the type of parameters.

// This is amazing: reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { s1, s2 in return s1 > s2 } )

// Let's use the example that inferr the [aramerer type


// No parettheses

names.sorted(by: {s1, s2 in return s1 > s2})


//4- Implicit Returns from Single-Expression Closures

//We can omit the the return type.

let xx = names.sorted(by: {s1, s2 in s1 < s2} )


print(xx)


let yu = names.sorted(by: {s1, s2 in
     s1 > s2
})

// Last type: argument name: $0, $1 $2 $3 $4  // These refer to the parameter number.

var returned = names.sorted(by: {$0 < $1})
print(returned)


// This is how we use trailing closure expression.
let trainling = names.sorted() {s1,s2 in
    s1 > s2
}

let trailing2 = names.sorted() {
    $0 < $1
}




// Trainling function.
