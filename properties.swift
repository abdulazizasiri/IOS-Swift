// Lazy property:
/*
 Lazy properties are useful when the initial value for a property is dependent on outside factors whose values are not known until after an instanceâ€™s initialization is complete. Lazy properties are also useful when the initial value for a property requires complex or computationally expensive setup that should not be performed unless or until it is needed.
 
 */


// Lazy property is helpful: It is used to set the stored property to values that Can be Extremely large, in this case, you do not want any storage happening during initialization. After initialization that is ok.
